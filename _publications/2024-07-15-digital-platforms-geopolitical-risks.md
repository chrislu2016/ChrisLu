**Abstract:** In recent years, the public opinion risks faced by transnational digital platforms have become increasingly frequent and complex. Traditional commercial and cultural frameworks alone are insufficient to explain the sources of these risks or to help platforms effectively navigate crises. The numerous incidents involving TikTok across various countries demonstrate that the core motivations behind decisions on whether and how to impose sanctions on TikTok primarily focus on political factors such as expressing positions, exerting control, and balancing platform power. These motivations form the basic framework for analyzing and interpreting international risks to transnational digital platforms. From the perspective of information geopolitics, public opinion measures are emphasized in sanctions for two main reasons: first, they effectively undermine the trust foundations of platforms compared to traditional methods; second, they are more accessible and convenient for multiple stakeholders. However, beyond the issue of trust, these incidents highlight the intensifying contradiction between the monopolistic and public nature of platform models, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and major power rivalry. Addressing future risks will require a thorough understanding of risk sources, an emphasis on reinforcing platform trust resources, and a reformation of the ownership structures of transnational digital platforms. Additionally, it is essential to actively promote the integration of transnational digital platforms with the construction of a shared future for humanity.
