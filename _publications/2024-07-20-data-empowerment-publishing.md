**Abstract:** Data elements are high-quality production factors essential for forming new productive forces. Integrating data element resources, extracting their value, and building a cohesive data element system are of great significance for promoting the deep integration and transformative development of the publishing industry. This paper, from the perspective of new productive forces, explores the paths and mechanisms by which data elements empower the publishing industry's development across three dimensions: resource endowment, the publishing value chain, and the publishing industry chain. Combining data elements with the high-quality content resources of the publishing industry forms a unique resource endowment, opening up new avenues for industrial value growth. Additionally, data elements can empower the digital and intelligent transformation of various nodes in the publishing value chain, thereby promoting an increase in total factor productivity. The integration of data elements can also drive changes in production relations, shaping new production factors oriented toward the development of new productive forces and injecting fresh momentum into the high-quality development of the publishing industry and the broader socio-economic landscape.
