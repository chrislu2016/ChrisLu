**Abstract**: For a long time, the theatrical window has been a foundational rule in film distribution, accepted and consistently enforced by film producers, theaters, and streaming platforms. However, in recent years, the length of the theatrical window has shown a trend of gradual reduction. This phenomenon reflects a broader trend of **institutional logic convergence** across different film distribution windows. Analyzing the **institutional essence** of the theatrical window, this study identifies a **misalignment between institutional frameworks and dominant logics** as one of the primary causes of the current “growing pains” in the film distribution industry. Thus, promoting a more **flexible and customized approach** to window lengths and facilitating the deeper integration of online and theatrical windows are essential strategies for overcoming the current challenges surrounding theatrical windows.
