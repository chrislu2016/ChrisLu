**Abstract:** Since short video platforms began to enter the market, the micro-drama industry has embarked on a new phase of rapid growth. Within the video industry, various entities—including long video platforms and ordinary users—have historically followed different guiding logics due to distinct developmental histories and resources. With industry boundaries increasingly converging, the entry of short video platforms has not only injected fresh talent and content resources into the industry but, more importantly, has innovatively integrated the institutional advantages of both PGC and UGC logics. This has created a unified institutional environment for diverse stakeholders, reorganizing the existing market space and fostering diversified and rapid industry growth. It is essential for different entities within the micro-drama industry to leverage their unique resources to address incompatibilities between their institutional frameworks and the surrounding environment, thereby advancing the further integration of institutional logics.
