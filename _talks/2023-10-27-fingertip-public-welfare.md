I produced and conceptualized this initiative report and video to highlight the "Fingertip Public Welfare" project by the Tsinghua University Education Foundation. This micro-donation platform mobilizes alumni contributions to support student-led social practice teams. The video showcases impactful work across China, from music education in Xinjiang to art and science outreach in rural communities, illustrating the strength of alumni-student connections and the meaningful contributions these teams make in underserved areas.
